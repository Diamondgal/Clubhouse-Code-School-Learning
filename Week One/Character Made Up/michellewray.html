	<h1>Mi-chelle Wray In a Nut-chell</h1>
	<p>I am a multi-skilled entrepreneur currently taking a break from formal work to settle my family into our new home
		across the Atlantic from South Africa - in America. My professional experience over two and a half decades includes 6
		years operational management in the hospitality sector, 5 years at senior marketing manager level in IT and Banking,
		2 years marketing manco with Ernst & Young, 9 years as Founding Member of my own sales and marketing company, 4 years
		director for sales and marketing in property development and this a year as senior management for a JSE-listed
		property fund.</p>
	<h2>Personal Motto</h2>
	<p>My personal creed comes from the well-known excerpt from Theodore Roosevelt's Citizen's in Republic speech; <i>"It
			is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds
			could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by
			dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no
			effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the
			great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
			achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never
			be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory or defeat.</i></p>


	<h1><strong>Some of My Recent Valiant Efforts</strong></h1>
	<p>Keep reading below for bite-size highlights of my more valiant work efforts. You can also scroll to the end, grab
		my number and call me to start a conversation.</p>
	<h3><strong>Vukile Property Fund - JSE listed property fund with a market cap $2 billion.</h3>
	<p><strong>The work:</strong><br><i>The CEO mandated me to run the alternative income division as a separate business.
			I needed to find innovative solutions to secure long-term strategies to secure revenue and deliver sticky tenants
			and sticky shoppers in an evolving retail landscape.</i><br><strong>My Effort: </strong><br><i> I engaged the
			leading mobile network company in South Africa, (MTN) to lay a fibre-optic network into 40 Retail Shopping Centers,
			entered into a JV with Plutus Commerce South Africa to use their targeted marketing software to drive shopper
			engagement and increase revenue via a hyper location CISCO wi-fi installation; appointed sales teams to sell the
			advertising opportunities; entered into a JV with Eighty20 Consultants to explore revenue opportunities generated
			off the data; and appointed an in-house outsourced marketing team with Oliver Africa Agency to create our Shopper
			Club content. Additionally, I maximized traditional third-party advertising revenue and rooftop telecommunications
			with various legal
			agreements.</i></p><br><strong>This most recent experience is an area I would like to explore in the United States
		with property owners.</strong>
	<h3>Nedbank, one of the big four banks in South Africa. Retail Banking Division</h3>
	<p><strong>The work:</strong><br><i>To innovate and improve communication with the +-3000 staff located in 500-plus
			branches across South Africa. The brief was to find a way to grow the heart in the business, to be real -(not some
			cold corporate communication)-I needed to find ways to really engage their people and also share key messages. The
			leadership were deeply committed to making a great working place.</i><br><strong>My Effort: </strong><br> <i>I found
			some leading VPN-technology (pre-fibre) to deliver an in-house data-casting solution with SCALA software and
			installed 3 screens per branch. (1 for staff and 2 client-facing). I produced and hosted a weekly informal and
			informative-styled retail banking television show called Retail Detail. (So while it was still a one-dimensional
			communication channel - it got 3000 people connected at the same time once a week). I helped develop the network
			into a key marketing channel for clients by managing and producing product content. On the back of this
			infrastructure, I figured out how to launch an in-house radio station for the bank (Nedbank on Air). It was a
			cost-effective pre-recorded show which opened up an inexpensive two-way communication channel. The leadership really
			trusted me as these two communication channels grew as I was allowed free content creation and direction. They
			really listened to my insights based on their staff feedback. (and when I approached them to open their retail
			branches and do a blanket drive during winter and allow their people to wear warm winter pajama's to work- they
			agreed). I served this client for 8 years with various other initiatives including sales enhancement techniques,
			client-service programs and
			leadership development techniques. </i></p>
	<h3>Cancer Association of South Africa</h3>
	<p><strong>The work:</strong><br><i>When my friend's cancer reappeared, I promised her that she wouldn't be alone
			during her treatment. She told me that she couldn't face loosing her hair again and the public scrutiny of such a
			privately painful journey that made her feel so different from everyone else. So I told her I would get the whole of
			South Africa to shave their heads. (or spray them a wild color if they would not shave). And so began my journey
			into cause-related marketing.(Emily Dickinson's words could not have a stronger resounding alarm bell here : a word
			once said is dead some say, others say, they only begin to live that day’).</i><br><strong>My Effort: </strong><br><i>With
			another special friend and business partner, I initiated and delivered the National CANSA-SHAVATHON across South
			Africa for 3 years - raising over R25 million rand, achieving a Guinness World Record for all the South African’s
			who shaved or sprayed, shaving my own head bald and encouraging people to show their hearts by supporting the
			national event at multiple locations. (but most importantly - I continue to enjoy the friendship of my surviving
			friend). Shavathon remains the Cancer Association of South Africa's single biggest fund-raiser and a national iconic
			brand. Heart work as well as pioneering in the field of cause-related marketing.</i></p>
	<h3>Ernst & Young, South Africa. Audit Division</h3>
	<p><strong>The work:</strong><br><i>The Head of the Audit Division needed a way to get the audit partners to
			understand and support various key milestones in establishing long-term relationships to win key industry pursuits.
			and the text.</i><br><strong>My Effort: </strong><br><i>I developed an in-house program supporting EY’s global
			go-to-market strategy. Honestly, this work was a little like herding cats but somehow heads connected with hearts
			and the partner’s support for my program was shown with incremental behavior change and ultimately, over a two year
			period, the successful acquisition of new clients.</i></p>

	<h3>WrayPex Property Development Company</h3>
	<p><strong>The work:</strong><br><i>A successful privately owned South-African real estate development company dreamed
			a great big dream to create an exclusive golfing and equestrian estate.</i><br><strong>My Effort: </strong><br><i>
			Creating and developing the real estate aspirational life-style brand and leading the marketing and sales team.</i></p>
	<h1>Other stuff you will not know by looking at me</h1>
	<p>Worked as a radio talk show host under the pseudonym Michelle Diamond on a weekly Saturday breakfast show. Mom to 2
		amazing teenagers, step-mom to a fabulous young adult and the luckiest wife in the world.
		<h1>My black-box shared</h1>

					speak really fast and the decibels go up).</li>
				<li>I find amazing partners and people to work with to make things happen.</li>
				<li>I make mistakes.</li>
