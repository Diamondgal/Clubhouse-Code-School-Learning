#Clubhouse Codeschool Project Week Two
1. :+1: :octocat: *My second webpage ever built in HTML and CSS :tada:
2. The task is to build a web-page with some advanced html & css concepts. I wanted to link 3 html pages to one web-page. I inserted color changes to the links with a hover.
3. I used css transforms to build a 2D cube demo on the demiabout.html with 3 jpgs and had to use overflow.hidden to make the pictures work and also ensure width was set to 100%. Insanely proud when the hover actually worked! :sparkles: ![Image of Demi](Demifun1.jpg width="200" height="400")
